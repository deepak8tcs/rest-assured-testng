#REST Assured

REST Assured is an open source tool, Java based library that is used for RESTful API testing.

REST Assured can be used to test XML as well as JSON based web services. REST Assured can be integrated with JUnit and TestNG frameworks for writing test cases for our application.

REST Assured supports POST, GET, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, PATCH, and HEAD requests and can be used to validate and verify the response of these requests.

REST Assured is implemented in Groovy and uses the builder pattern to create requests, set headers, parse the response and then match them with expected data. It uses Hamcrest Matchers for comparing actual response with the expected response.

One of the powerful features of REST assured is the support of XML Path and JSON Path syntax to check specific elements of the response data. Itâ€™s very similar to using XPath API.
